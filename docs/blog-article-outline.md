**Real-world examples:**
- E-commerce site collecting test transactions in production
- Microservices with inconsistent naming conventions
- High-cardinality metrics causing cost spikes
- Missing correlation between traces and infrastructure

**Step-by-step walkthrough:**

#### A. Resource Detection Processor
```yaml
# Code snippet showing auto-discovery
resourcedetection:
  detectors: [docker, system, process]
  # Explain what each detector finds
```
- **What it discovers**: Container info, system details, process metadata
- **Business value**: Automatic infrastructure correlation
- **Configuration tips**: Which detectors to use when

#### B. Attribute Transformation
```yaml
# Pattern matching and extraction examples
attributes:
  actions:
    - key: service.name
      pattern: ^(.*)-(dev|staging|prod)$
      action: extract
```
- **Pattern matching**: Regex-based data extraction
- **Cross-references**: Linking related attributes
- **Grafana optimization**: Labels for better dashboards

#### C. Dynamic Filtering
```yaml
# Environment-based filtering
filter:
  traces:
    span:
      - 'resource.attributes["environment"] == "dev"'
```
- **Cost control**: Dropping irrelevant data
- **Security**: PII removal and compliance
- **Performance**: Sampling strategies

#### D. Metrics Transformation
```yaml
# Metric normalization and enrichment
metricstransform:
  transforms:
    - include: "http_request_duration_seconds"
      operations:
        - action: add_label
          new_label: grafana_instance
```
- **Standardization**: Consistent metric formats
- **Enrichment**: Adding business context
- **Aggregation**: Reducing cardinality

### 5. Real-World Use Cases (600-700 words)
**Subheadings:**
- "E-commerce Platform: Customer Journey Tracking"
- "Financial Services: Compliance and Risk Management"
- "SaaS Platform: Multi-tenant Observability"

#### Use Case 1: E-commerce Platform
**Challenge**: Tracking customer journeys across microservices
**Solution**: Dynamic processors that:
- Automatically detect service relationships
- Enrich traces with customer context
- Filter out internal health checks
- Calculate business metrics (conversion rates, cart abandonment)

**Code example**: Customer segmentation processor
**Results**: 50% reduction in noise, 200% improvement in business insights

#### Use Case 2: Financial Services
**Challenge**: Regulatory compliance and risk management
**Solution**: Dynamic processors that:
- Automatically remove PII from traces
- Add compliance tags based on data sensitivity
- Route high-risk transactions to specialized pipelines
- Generate audit trails automatically

**Code example**: Compliance processor with PII masking
**Results**: 100% compliance automation, 90% faster audit preparation

#### Use Case 3: SaaS Platform
**Challenge**: Multi-tenant observability without data leakage
**Solution**: Dynamic processors that:
- Automatically isolate tenant data
- Add tenant-specific labels
- Apply tenant-specific sampling rates
- Route to tenant-specific storage

**Code example**: Tenant isolation processor
**Results**: Zero data leakage incidents, 40% cost reduction per tenant
